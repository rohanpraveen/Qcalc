# Calculator Project

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Calculator Project where I've dived into the world of Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to build a cool calculator with a bunch of nifty features. ðŸ§®

# Objective

The main goal of this project was to get my hands dirty and gain some solid skills in Java programming and OOPs concepts. To make things exciting, I decided to replicate a subset of the features you usually find in calculators.

# Qcalc
The objective of this project is to obtain basic skills in Java and OOPs principles by building a subset of features seen in calculators.

During the course of this project,

1. Made use of different features of VSCode IDE to build the project.
2. Built feature of a calculator by taking OOPS Principles into consideration.
3. Implement new methods to support floating point arithmetic operations using method overloading.
   
Skills used:

Java, Unit Testing, JUnit

# Implement Simple Calculator

Scope of work,

1. Generate a Java Gradle Project using Spring Initializer Extension in VSCode IDE.
2. Implement basic arithmetic operations with two numbers and write unit tests to verify the functionalities.
3. Implement new methods to support floating point arithmetic operations using method overloading.

Skills used:

Java, Unit Testing, JUnit

# Identify and Handle Exceptions

Scope of work,

1. Identify and Handle Exceptions for invalid data.
2. Write unit tests to validate the Exception being thrown.

Skills used:

Java, Unit Testing, JUnit, Exception Handling

# Implement Scientific Calculator

Scope of work,
1. Extend the existing class to support new features for a Scientific Calculator.
2. Re-use and improve upon the existing features.

Skills used:

Java

# Debug and Fix Issues

Scope of work,
1. Fix compilation errors caused probably due to syntax / import issues.
2. Correct logical issues in the code.
3. Fix the behaviour of a method when data is invalid.
4. Write Unit Tests for edge cases initially not thought of.
